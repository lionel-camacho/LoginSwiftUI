# LoginSwiftUI

A sample app demonstrating:
- SwiftUI login screen
- SwiftUI account creation screen
- SwiftUI user list screen
- Networking and error handling
- Alerts
- Navigation using SwiftUI Navigation Links
- SwiftUI user details screen
- SwiftUI map with Pin
- Unit tests
- MVVM Architecture
- Persisting data with UserDefaults

What I would imporve given more time:
- Persist data using Realm instead of UserDefaults
- Add a screen where the logged in user can update their persisted details
- Add UI tests
- Refactor to remove some duplication
